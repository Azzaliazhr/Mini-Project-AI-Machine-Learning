# Student Scores Prediction
Machine Learning regression project to predict student exam scores based on study hours.

## Project Overview
This project compares three regression models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## Key Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering : Check Duplicated Data, Check Missing Value Handling, Outlier Analysis
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Visualization of Predictions

## Conclusion
**Random Forest Regressor** showed the best performance with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 13.045153611111104 and highest R² score is 0.9778294466160586.

## Tools Used
- Python (3.10+), Google Colab
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
