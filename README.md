# 🎓 Student Scores Prediction

Machine Learning regression project to predict student exam scores based on study hours.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project compares three regression models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

The goal is to find the best-performing model to accurately predict scores.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Visualization of Predictions

## 📈 Conclusion
✅ **Random Forest Regressor** showed the best performance with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and highest R² score.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (3.10+), Google Colab
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📁 Files
- `student_score_analysis_3_models.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook
- `student_scores.xlsx` — Input dataset
